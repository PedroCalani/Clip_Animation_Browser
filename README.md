# Clip_Animation_Browser

This is a Houdini Shelf tool for previewing animation clips before importing them.
You can view all the clips in a folder in video, and select the ones you want to import.
You can also filter them to easily find specific clips that you want.

### How to install:
1) Download clip_animation_browser.shelf and copy it to your houdini toolbar folder. This will usually be in "C:\Users\NAME\Documents\houdini20.0\toolbar".
2) In houdini you have to add the shelf to your workspace.

### Attention:
1. The first time the tool will make one video for each fbx animation file you have.
  It may take a few seconds per clip depending on its duration.
2. It is required to have ffmpeg installed.
3. Don't worry if terminal windows opens and close while the process! It's ffmpeg saving the video in your folder with animations.
